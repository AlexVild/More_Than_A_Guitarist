            <h1>What is this?</h1>
            <p>So you want to learn guitar, ay? Well, so do many others. Frankly, it's gotten to be a little overwhelming. So many people in the world can pick up a guitar and play a song- hell, some can even sing along with their playing! How on earth could you ever compete with that?</p>
            <p>The problem with these kinds of guitar players is that they're just that- guitar players. They, typically, aren't really musicians, in that    they don't really know much about music or how to write it, or even play along with somebody.</p>
            <p>It's worth noting that these people are at no fault! If your goal with the guitar is just to learn some of your favorite songs and never create music either by yourself or with others, then simply looking up tabs on sites like <a href="http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/">Ultimate Guitar</a> will completely fulfill your needs! What my site aims to do is help guitarists that are looking to actually create their own music, or even just learn how to jam with others!</p>
            <h1>So what's on the site?</h1>
            <p>On this site are all of the things you will need to learn for playing guitar as a musician. We will cover the absolute basics of playing guitar and work our way up to basic music theory and applying it to your guitar. This will be done with simple to understand images and videos made by myself. If you're interested in playing guitar, or if you've been playing solely from tab and chord memorization then I really think you could get something out of this site!</p>
            <p>Also, my resources will always be free because I mean come on this stuff isn't rocket science, it's just music. And music makes the world go round.</p>
