        <h1>Lesson 3- The Four Chords of Justice</h1>
        <p>So now we're going to cover some basic chord progressions that are used <i>everywhere</i>. A chord progression is just a sequence of                     chords that are used as the building blocks of a song. They are sort of what gives a song its feel, while the melody (the part of a song
            that you hum) is the soul of the song.</p>
            
        <p>Or something.</p>    
            
        <p>Basically I am again going to kind of go against what the point of this website is and just teach you basic stuff without going into
            why it works and what it's used for <i>but we'll get there eventually.</i> First we have to give your fingers some brains, and to do
            that requires a LOT of practice, so don't get lazy, and don't get discouraged. No one picks up a guitar and just goes to town if
            they've never played before, and learning how to play an instrument is half knowledge of music (which we'll get to) and half <i>endless
            practice</i>. Chord progressions can be rough but if you practice them for 20 minutes a day for one week you will immediately see                     improvement.</p>    
        
        <p>Motivational speaking aside, let's get to the chord progressions.</p>    
            
        <p>There's basically two versions of this chord progression we're going to look at and they are used everywhere- once you pick up on them,
            you will start to hear them everywhere. We will start with the "Major" variation of this progressions.It's also worth noting that these are all going to be played in the key of G major, which as of now means that the first chord in the progressions is, in fact, a G major chord. However, not all of these songs are in G major, which is why these progressions might not sound right if yu play them along with the real song.
            Yet again, we will come back to this later but without further adieu, the progression we are going to be talking about right now is:</p>
            
        <p><b><a href="lesson_src/lesson_2/G%20major.jpg">G</a> <a href="lesson_src/lesson_2/D%20major.jpg">D</a> <a href="lesson_src/lesson_2/E%20minor.jpg">Em</a> <a href="lesson_src/lesson_2/C%20major.jpg">C</a></b></p>    
            
        <p>Go ahead and try to play this progression, just play each chord in full for now, make sure it sounds good, and then move on. Just try to                 get the transition between the chords to be smooth, and then move on to playing with a metronome.</p> 
        
        <p>A metronome is just a tool that keeps a rhythm in BPM (beats-per-minute, where each click is a "beat"). What I want you to do is using
            this <a href = "http://a.bestmetronome.com/">metronome</a> and starting at 40BPM, play the G chord, and then after you hear 4 clicks,
            strum the next chord. Do this until you can do it comfortably and having it sound clean before bumping up the BPM by 20. Try to get to
            180BPM within two weeks (try this exercise for maybe 10 minutes every day), with any of the chord progressions on this page).</p>    
            
        <p>This is a fantastic exercise to build some finger dexterity, and it can come in handy with friends if you're just trying to jam
            to some simple songs.</p>
            
        <p>In case you want to be sure you're doing the exercise correctly, what you need to do is strum your first chord on one beat, then hold
            the chord for at least two beats after the one you strum on. Then, you get a one beat break to get your fingers in the right position,
            then you strum the next chord and repeat this process. When you get truly comfortable with this exercise, you can get rid of the "rest
            beat" and just hold the chord until just before it's time to play the next one. This is generally what you'd want to do.</p>
            
        <p>You can use this exercise with this progression as well: </p>
            
        <p><b><a href="lesson_src/lesson_2/E%20minor.jpg">Em</a> <a href="lesson_src/lesson_2/C%20major.jpg">C</a> <a href="lesson_src/lesson_2/G%20major.jpg">G</a> <a href="lesson_src/lesson_2/D%20major.jpg">D</a></b></p>  
        
        <p>This is the "minor" version of the same progression, essentially. For now, the difference between major and minor is that major sounds
            happier and upbeat, while minor might sound more sad or heroic.</p>   
            
        <p>Here's a list of songs just from the top of my head that use these progressions! If you get really comfortable with playing these and
            want to try singing and playing, these are great practice for building the connections in your brain to allow singing and playing.</p>
