            <h1>Lesson 4- Notes on the Neck</h1>
            <p>So as we discussed in Lesson 1, the open strings are all assigned a <b>note.</b> A note is just a name assigned to a certain
            sound in music, and they are universal. An E will always be an E in music- the only thing that could be different about one E to another                 is the <b>octave</b>. An octave is just how high or low pitched a note is, and they are designated with a number proceeding the note name.               For an example, the open "E" string on a guitar (the thickest string, on top of the neck looking down in a playing position) is an E2,
            where "E" is the note and "2" is the octave it is in. A guitar in standard tuning goes from an E2 and most guitars go to about a C6,
            though some guitars have more or less frets.</p>
            
            <p>Now obviously, the open strings aren't the only notes on a guitar. Anytime you are pressing down on a fret, you are playing
            a different note. It's important to memorize at least the E and A strings. That sounds (and looks, as you'll see in a second) very
            daunting, but it's important to note that their are really easily recognizable patterns, and it's really just a 12 letter alphabet.</p>
            
            <p>Essentially, the notes go A-G#/Ab. A "#" symbol following a note is called a <b>sharp</b> while a "b" is called a <b>flat</b>.
            These symbols essentially mean they are the note in between one note and another. This sounds confusing. It'll make more sense
            if we look at the neck.</p>

            <p>See what I mean? A "F#" (F sharp) is the same thing as a "Gb" (G flat). The thing worth noting, however, is that there <b>is
                no B# or E#, and thusly no Cb or Fb</b>. However, look how simple this is! It's just the alphabet, but with sharps (or flats,
                they sound the same just different notation) in between certain letters. Their are many shortcuts to memorizing these notes,
                however, and here's the first one.</p>
             
            <a name="s1"></a> 
            <p><h2 align="center">Shortcut #1: The twelfth fret is the same as the open string</h2></p>
            <p>This means that the eleventh fret is the last one you need to memorize, as the pattern will restart at the twelfth fret (the twelfth               fret is an octave above the open string it is on). Also
            take time to memorize the "dots" on the fretboard (or on the side of your guitar). They are there to make it easier to find certain
            frets- as you probably have noticed, the first dot is on the third fret, then the fifth, then the seventh, ninth, and the double dot
            marks the twelfth fret (showing that it's the same as the open string, just an octave up).</p>
            <p>Let's move on to the A string.</p>
            
            <center><img src="lesson_src/lesson_4/notes_on_neck_Astring_PDN.png" style="max-width: 50%"></center>
        
            <p>Oh jesus, that's a lot of notes! WELL LUCKY FOR YOU, it's still just as easy to recognize thanks to the magic of shortcut #2.</p>
            <a name="s2"></a>     
            <p><h2 align="center">Shortcut #2: The fifth fret is the next string down (except on the G string)</h2></p>
            <p>Ta-da! This is a really useful shortcut, especially once you get the first string memorized.</p>
            
            <center><img src="lesson_src/lesson_4/notes_on_neck_Arrows_PDN.png" style="max-width: 50%"></center>
            
            <p>Also worth mentioning is that the reverse of this exists.</p>  
            <a name="s3"></a> 
            <h2 align="center">Shortcut #3: The seventh fret is the same as the string below (except on the B string)</h2>
            <p>You can see this as we continue. So now I will just keep going until we reach the B string.</p>
            
            <center><img src="lesson_src/lesson_4/notes_on_neck_Bstring_PDN.png" style="max-width: 50%"></center>
            
            <p>As you might be able to see, the B string <i>ruins everything we have been working on.</i> Obviously nothing fundamental changes,
            but what does change is the shortcuts. <b>These changes only apply to the B and G strings.</b> On the G string, the fourth fret is the
            next string up (B), NOT the fifth fret. On the B string, the eighth fret is the string below (G), NOT the seventh fret.</p>
            <p>What is extremely nice is that the e string is the same exact thing as the E string, the only difference is the e string starts at
            an e4, while the E string starts at an E2, so they're just different octaves!</p>
            
            <center><img src="lesson_src/lesson_4/notes_on_neck_Complete.png" style=max-width:50%></center>
            
            <p>You don't need to memorize every note on the neck (though it certainly does not hurt). You just need to know the first two strings,
            which really only requires knowledge of the first string and the various shortcuts.</p>
            <p>AND SPEAKING OF SHORTCUTS, there's one more worth mentioning and that's finding octaves on different strings. We already know about
            the magic of the twelfth fret and the seventh fret, but what about if you go down two strings? Well, then you just simply go down
            two frets and down two strings. This is different on the D and G strings, as the B string throws everything off. Then it is just
            three frets down instead of two. This is more clearly demonstrated in the picture below.</p>
            <a name="s4"></a> 
            <h2 align="center">Shortcut #4</h2>
    
            <center><img src="lesson_src/lesson_4/shortcuts.png" style=max-width:50%></center>
            
            <p>So that's the notes on the neck. Again, you really only need to know the shortcuts and the first two strings (even just
            the E string works).</p>
