            <h1>Lesson 5- The Major Scale</h1>
            <p>So now we're going to dive in to discussion of keys and scales, and really for the first time start talking about music theory.
            It can get a little confusing, but really nothing is that complex when you look at it surface level.</p>
            
            <p>So as you may have noticed, two words have been thrown around a bit, and they are <b>major</b> and <b>minor</b>. Essentially,
            things that are major sound much more upbeat and happy while things that are minor may be heroic or sad. A good song example
            of this is Guns N' Roses' <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w7OgIMMRc4">Sweet Child O' Mine</a>. The song starts out
            in a major key and ends in a minor key. You can hear this shift if you quickly skip around while listening to the song.</p>
            
            <p>Major and Minor are words that describe <b>keys</b>. The key of a song is the backbone of a song. It is like the language
            being used to wrtie the music of a song (the lyrics, if any, are obviously the literal interpretation).</p>
            
            <p>A key is written, for example, as "A minor", or "C major", or anything like that. </p>
