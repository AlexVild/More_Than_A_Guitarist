            <p><h1>Lesson 1- Intro to the Guitar</h1></p>
            <p>If you've already fooled around with the guitar a bit, you can skip this lesson!</p>
            <p>If not, then let's dive in! The guitar is a pretty simple instrument with not a lot of parts to it.
                Essentially, there is the <b>strings</b>, <b>frets,</b> <b>tuning pegs</b>, <b>bridge</b>, and <b>nut</b>.
                You can refer to the diagram below to see what these are on the guitar.</p>
            <a name="parts"></a> 
            <center><img src="lesson_src/lesson_1/guitar_parts.png" style="max-width: 100%" alt="The parts of a basic acoustic guitar"></a></center>
            <p>Pay no attention to how horrible that image is. In theory it does the job. Also note that your guitar might not look exactly
                like this- this is a classical guitar with a cut away body. The parts are still the same.</p>
            <p>Now, what do each of these parts do?</p>
            
            <p><h3>Bridge</h3></p>
            <p>This bridge, essentially, just holds the strings up such as to allow them to vibrate and create sound. If you ever replace the
                strings on a guitar, there are typically small notches on the bridge that hold the strings in place. That's all there really is to
                it, the only other thing worth mentioning is that some guitars might need this adjusted (you can get this checked and done for cheap
                at most guitar stores), as the bridge may be too high and need lowered so the strings are easier to press down.</p>
            
            <p><h3>Strings</h3></p>
            <p>Well even less to say about these. These are what make music on the guitar! They are what you pluck or pick to allow them to vibrate                 and create sound. These strings need to be tuned correctly, and if you just got your guitar, chances are you need to change your                       strings (you can find a great tutorial for this <a href ="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xxeRFEP1Y4">here</a>, or again many guitar                 stores will do it for you. I recommend Elixir or Ernie Ball acoustic strings). These also can break occasionally, which is always
              fun.</p>

            <p><h3>Frets</h3></p>
            <p>The metal seperators on the neck of the guitar are the frets. These allow you to change the sound your string makes. <b>A common                     problem many beginners face is trying to play on the actual, metal fret. Don't do this.</b> You don't play guitar like this. You
              should always aim to play inbetween the two metal bars, not on them. This can be kind of confusing when people say things like
              "first fret", all they mean when they say this is the first "gap" between the nut and the first metal bar on the neck.</p>

            <p><h3>Nut</h3></p>
            <p>The nut is essentially a bridge on the other side of the neck. Not a whole lot to say about it either, but essentially the nut acts
                as a way to keep the strings in line.</p>

            <p><h3>Tuning Pegs</h3></p>
            <p>Okay, these are important. These pegs tighten/loosen the strings on the guitar and allow them to make different sounds (a guitar
                works by plucking strings and allowing them to vibrate- slower, looser vibrations allow for deeper tones while faster, tight 
                vibrations provide the opposite). I don't believe there is any standard to which direction does what, but for me personally and
                most guitars I've played, counter-clockwise rotations make the string tighter, while clockwise rotations do the opposite. Again,
                tighter makes a higher pitch and looser means lower.</p>
            <a name="tuning"></a>
            <p>You want to tune the guitar strings to the following pitches.</p>
            <center><img src="lesson_src/lesson_1/Strings.png" style="max-width:40%"></center>
            <p>Where the "E" string is the thickest string on your guitar.</p>
            <p>Each of these letters are called <b>notes</b>. Notes are what music is made of. The notes go from A-G# (G sharp), and their are                         variations of some of these notes called <b>accidentals</b> (such as the sharp on that G# I just mentioned), but we'll cover that later. 
                Just know that you are tuning these strings to six
                different notes of music, and when you play one of these strings openly, you are playing that note (for example, strumming the
                thick string, when tuned correctly, means you are playing an "E").</p>
            <p><b>It is incredibly important that you tune these strings correctly.</b> You can find a online tuner 
                <a href="http://www.8notes.com/guitar_tuner/">here</a>, but it requires you to have a good ear (which you may not have yet).
                I really recommend that you buy a guitar tuner, but you can find some on all smart phones to hold you over until then.</p>
            <p><br>Throughout these lessons I may be referring to your fingers as numbers. If you're right handed, these numbers correspond like 
                so:</p>

            <center><img src="lesson_src/lesson_1/hand.jpg" style="max-width:30%" border = "2"></center>
            <p>Fairly obvious but you never know- and if you're left handed of course these still correspond to the same fingers 
                (1 on index, etc.)</p>
            <p>This concludes this lesson- the most obvious lesson of all time but still it is necesarry.</p>
