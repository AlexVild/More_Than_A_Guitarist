            <p><h1>Lesson 2- Open Chords</h1></p>
            <p>So now we're going to get you to playing simple songs- we're not going to discuss any of the music theory behind how they work,
                why they work, what they do, how you can use them, nothing. Right now we are simply going to learn the shapes and make sure that
                you can play these chords cleanly.</p>
            <p>In guitar, the open chords are sort of the basis for a lot of guitar based music as they are really easy to play and often times
                very versatile in song writing. They're called open chords because they all utilize playing at least one string in the open position
                (i.e. not pressing any of the frets on a string that is being strummed).</p>
            <p>There's not a whole lot to say about these right now, so let's just get to the sweet, sweet diagrams. I've organized these to go
                in the order of what I believe to be easiest to hardest.</p>
            <p>While playing these chords, <b>PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU GET THE CHORD TO SOUND GOOD.</b> You can compare how your chords sound to    
                mine, and make sure that every string in the chord plays a full, strong note when strummed. Nothing should sound muffled or
                "off". You'll be able to tell when something's wrong.</p>
            <p>In these diagrams, the dots on the strings are the frets you should be playing, and the numbers are the fingers I recommend using.
                An "x" on the top of a string means that you <b>don't strum that string</b> when playing the chord. A small "m" after a chord 
                means that the chord is a minor chord, for example, this first chord is called "E minor". If there is no "m" or there <i>is</i> a 
                "M", then that chord is major (for example G major can be just called "G" or "GM", but a G minor would be notated "Gm").</p>
            <h3>E minor</h3>
            <a name="Em"></a> 
            <p><center><img src="lesson_src/lesson_2/E%20minor.jpg" style="max-width: 70%"></center></p>
            <h3>E Major (Same as E, or EM)</h3>
            <a name="E"></a> 
            <p><center><img src="lesson_src/lesson_2/E%20major.jpg" style="max-width: 70%"></center></p>
            <h3>D</h3>
            <a name="D"></a> 
            <p><center><img src="lesson_src/lesson_2/D%20major.jpg" style="max-width: 70%"></center></p>
            <h3>D minor</h3>
            <a name="Dm"></a> 
            <p><center><img src="lesson_src/lesson_2/D%20minor.jpg" style="max-width: 70%"></center></p>
            <h3>A minor</h3>
            <a name="Am"></a> 
            <p><center><img src="lesson_src/lesson_2/A%20minor.jpg" style="max-width: 70%"></center></p>
            <h3>A</h3>
            <a name="A"></a> 
            <p><center><img src="lesson_src/lesson_2/A%20major.jpg" style="max-width: 70%"></center></p>
            <h3>G (Sometimes played with an open B string)</h3>
            <a name="G"></a> 
            <p><center><img src="lesson_src/lesson_2/G%20major.jpg" style="max-width: 70%"></center></p>
            <h3>C (Playing the thick E string is largely optional, if not then use your third finger on the third fret on the "A" string)</h3>
            <a name="C"></a> 
            <p><center><img src="lesson_src/lesson_2/C%20major.jpg" style="max-width: 70%"></center></p>
            <h3>B Dominant Seventh</h3>
            <a name="B7"></a> 
            <p><center><img src="lesson_src/lesson_2/B%20dominant%20seventh.jpg" style="max-width: 70%"></center></p>
            
            <p>Like I said, the only thing you need to focus on right now with these is to get them to all sound clear and correct. 
                In the next lessons, we will start using these to form simple chord progressions and play some basic songs, 
                which involves quickly changing between chords.</p>
            <p>As of now, these shapes sort of just need to be committed to memory (a lot of playing guitar involves memorization of patterns, but it 
                can be easy to do).</p>
